Just a tiny Chrome extension to:

- grab all Links (anchors) on the current page
- adds them to the DOM of the current document (with a target="\_blank")
- clicks each link

To "Install":

- Open Chrome
- Goto Extensions
- Enable Developer mode (see switch on the right side)
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Select the folder with the files from this repository
- Goto a page and click the Cactus :-)

Nothing fancy but easily customized to do other things.

Created for a friend who needed to grab all PDFs on a site which used a Cookie-based authentication scheme.

May the Bob be with you ...
